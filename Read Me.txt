Blogging Website Project- In this project, I have used multiple programming languages like for front-end development I have used HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript whereas for backend I have used Jquery, Servlet, JSP, and JDBC. This was my most successor project till now, I have spent 1 month and 15 days to complete and work very enthusiastically and delicately.
